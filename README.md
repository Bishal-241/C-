# C-
Hey guys it is Bishal Shah a grade 10 student and this is my first c++ project.
My next project step to advance c
it's 24th of may 2022 and let's boom
 


1.Binary Search
It is one of the most famous searching alogorithm among other algorithms as it is faster and time efficient compared to other most of them.It is faster because it take n/2 iteration search and object from an sorted array.The effieciency comparision keeps increasing as the array size increases .

step1:check if number is greater or smaller than mid term array
step2:if(array[mid] > number) then iterate array from mid ie n/2 till final and check during each iteration
else:iterate array from mid ie n/2 till zero index and check during each iteration
steps:That's how it works
